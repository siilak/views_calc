My development for views_calc @ Drupal 7
==========

This module adds simple calculations to a views table. Requires the Views module.

You can SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, or AVG selected columns. 
A plug in theme makes the view look more spreadsheet-like
(right justifies numeric fields, shades calculated columns and rows, and underlines calculated rows).

Original module is here: http://drupal.org/project/views_calc
