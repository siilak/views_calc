<h1>Development for calculated views in Drupal 7</h1>

<h3>This module adds simple calculations to a views table. Requires the Views module.</h3>

You can SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, or AVG selected columns.
A plug in theme makes the view look more spreadsheet-like
(right justifies numeric fields, shades calculated columns and rows, and underlines calculated rows).
